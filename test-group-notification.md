## ðŸ§ª HOW TO TEST END-TO-END

### Test Scenario: Group Invitation Flow

1. **Setup**: 
   - User A creates a group
   - User A invites User B to the group

2. **Expected Flow**:
   ```
   User A actions:
   1. Create group â†’ Group created with invite code
   2. Add User B as member â†’ Notification sent to User B
   
   User B receives notification:
   3. Push notification appears with group name and sender info
   4. User B sees notification with action buttons: "Join", "Decline", "View"
   
   User B interactions:
   5a. Tap "Join" â†’ Automatically joins group + success notification + navigates to group
   5b. Tap "Decline" â†’ Shows decline confirmation notification
   5c. Tap "View" â†’ Opens app and navigates to group details screen
   ```

3. **Key Implementation Details**:
   - **Authentication**: `handleJoinGroup()` now properly gets current user via `AuthService.getCurrentUser()`
   - **Error Handling**: All handlers include proper try-catch with user-friendly error messages
   - **Navigation**: Uses `triggerAppNavigation()` to route users to appropriate screens
   - **Notifications**: Shows success/confirmation notifications after actions

### Test Points to Verify:

#### âœ… Notification Sending
- [ ] Group invitation notification sent when adding member
- [ ] Notification includes proper group and sender information
- [ ] Notification has correct category and action buttons

#### âœ… Notification Actions
- [ ] "Join" button successfully joins user to group
- [ ] "Decline" button shows confirmation message
- [ ] "View" button opens app and navigates to group details

#### âœ… Navigation Flow
- [ ] After joining: User sees success message and group interface
- [ ] Navigation data includes group context (groupId, inviteCode, etc.)
- [ ] Proper error handling if user is not authenticated

#### âœ… User Experience
- [ ] Notifications appear with rich content (group name, sender info)
- [ ] Action buttons work without requiring app to be open
- [ ] Smooth transition from notification action to app interface

## ðŸš€ CURRENT STATUS

**âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All critical bugs fixed, ready for testing!

The group invitation notification system is now fully implemented and the critical TypeScript compilation error has been resolved. The `handleJoinGroup` method properly accesses the current user ID via `AuthService.getCurrentUser()`, ensuring the notification actions work correctly.

**Next Steps**: 
- Test the complete flow in the app
- Verify notification actions work as expected
- Ensure proper navigation after notification interactions
