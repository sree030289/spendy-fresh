## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Core Components Implemented:

1. **NotificationManager** (`src/services/NotificationManager.ts`)
   - Centralized notification management
   - Automatic triggers for expense and group activities
   - Caching to prevent duplicate notifications
   - Deep linking data preparation

2. **SplittingService Integration** (`src/services/firebase/splitting.ts`)
   - Enhanced `addExpense()` with NotificationManager
   - Enhanced `addGroupMember()` with group invitation notifications
   - Enhanced `markPaymentAsPaid()` with settlement notifications
   - Added `getUserById()` method for user data retrieval

3. **Deep Linking Handler** (`src/screens/main/RealSplittingScreen.tsx`)
   - Navigation intent processing from notifications
   - Seamless user experience from notification to app content
   - Context-aware navigation with proper state management

4. **App Initialization** (`App.tsx`)
   - NotificationManager initialization when user authenticates
   - Integration with existing notification infrastructure

## üîß KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### NotificationManager Features:
```typescript
// Automatic expense notifications
await notificationManager.notifyExpenseAdded(expense, groupData, paidByUserId);

// Group invitation notifications with rich content
await notificationManager.notifyGroupInvitation(groupId, invitedUserId, inviterUserId);

// Payment settlement notifications
await notificationManager.notifyPaymentSettlement(fromUserId, toUserId, amount, currency, expenseId);
```

### Enhanced Notification Content:
- **Expense Notifications**: Include expense details, group context, and payer information
- **Group Invitations**: Rich invitations with group description, sender info, and action buttons
- **Payment Settlements**: Clear settlement information with amounts and context

### Deep Linking Actions:
- **"Join Group"**: Automatically joins user to group and navigates to group interface
- **"View Expense"**: Navigates to expense details within group context
- **"Split Expense"**: Opens expense splitting interface for the relevant group
- **"View Payment"**: Shows payment settlement details and history

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ Expense Notification Flow
- [ ] Create expense in group ‚Üí Members receive push notifications
- [ ] Notification includes correct expense details (amount, description, payer)
- [ ] Notification actions ("View", "Split") navigate to correct screens
- [ ] In-app notification records are created correctly

### ‚úÖ Group Invitation Flow  
- [ ] Add member to group ‚Üí Invited user receives rich invitation notification
- [ ] "Join" action automatically adds user to group with success message
- [ ] "Decline" action shows confirmation without joining
- [ ] "View" action opens app and shows group details

### ‚úÖ Payment Settlement Flow
- [ ] Mark payment as paid ‚Üí Relevant users receive settlement notifications
- [ ] Notification includes payment amount, currency, and parties involved
- [ ] Navigation from notification shows correct payment context

### ‚úÖ Deep Linking Integration
- [ ] Notifications clicked from outside app navigate to correct screens
- [ ] App state is properly updated after notification navigation
- [ ] Multiple notification clicks are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid/expired notification data

## üîÑ INTEGRATION POINTS

### Existing Services Enhanced:
1. **PushNotificationService**: Used for sending push notifications with rich content
2. **SplittingService**: Enhanced with NotificationManager integration
3. **RealNotificationService**: Handles notification action responses and deep linking
4. **ExpenseRefreshService**: Coordinates with notification system for real-time updates

### New Service Dependencies:
- NotificationManager ‚Üí SplittingService (for user data and group info)
- NotificationManager ‚Üí PushNotificationService (for notification delivery)
- RealSplittingScreen ‚Üí RealNotificationService (for navigation intent handling)

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Caching & Deduplication:
- **5-second notification cache** prevents duplicate notifications
- **Navigation intent cleanup** prevents memory leaks
- **Selective notification sending** only to relevant users

### Resource Management:
- **Automatic cleanup** of expired notification intents
- **Background processing** for notification preparation
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

---

## üì± USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS

### Rich Notification Content:
- Group names, sender information, and contextual descriptions
- Amount formatting with proper currency symbols
- Action buttons for immediate user interaction

### Seamless Navigation:
- One-tap join group from notifications
- Direct navigation to expense details
- Context preservation during navigation transitions

### Error Handling:
