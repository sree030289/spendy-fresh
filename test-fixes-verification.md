## Overview
Testing the implemented fixes for:
1. **Member Addition UI Refresh Issues** 
2. **Manual Settlement Parameter Validation**

## Test Cases

### 1. Member Addition UI Refresh Tests

#### Test 1.1: Group Member Addition Triggers Refresh

- **Steps**:
  1. Register multiple listeners
  2. Trigger member addition
  3. Verify all listeners receive notifications

### 2. Manual Settlement Parameter Validation Tests

#### Test 2.1: Amount Input Validation
- **Goal**: Test comprehensive amount validation in ManualSettlementModal
- **Test Cases**:
  - Empty input → Should show error
  - Non-numeric input → Should show error  
  - Negative amounts → Should show error
  - Zero amount → Should show error
  - Amount > 100,000 → Should show error
  - More than 2 decimal places → Should show error
  - Valid amounts → Should accept

#### Test 2.2: Real-time Input Formatting
- **Goal**: Test real-time input filtering and formatting
- **Test Cases**:
  - Character filtering (only numbers and decimal)
  - Single decimal point enforcement
  - Maximum value prevention
  - Proper formatting display

#### Test 2.3: Settlement All Balances Validation
- **Goal**: Test handleSettleAllBalances validation
- **Test Cases**:
  - Zero balance → Should not allow
  - Amount > 100,000 → Should show error
  - Valid balance → Should proceed with confirmation
  - Floating point precision handling

## Expected Results
- ✅ Member addition should refresh UI immediately
